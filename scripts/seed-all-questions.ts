    {
      title: 'The Impact of Social Media on Society',
      passage: `Social media platforms have dramatically altered the way people communicate and share information. While these platforms have enabled unprecedented global connectivity and given voice to marginalized communities, they have also been linked to mental health issues, particularly among young people. Studies show that excessive social media use correlates with increased rates of anxiety and depression. Furthermore, the spread of misinformation has become a significant challenge, as false information can travel faster than factual corrections. Policymakers and tech companies are grappling with how to regulate these platforms while preserving freedom of expression. The debate continues over whether the benefits of social media—connectivity, access to information, economic opportunities—outweigh its considerable drawbacks.`,
      sampleAnswer: 'Social media has revolutionized global communication and connectivity, but despite enabling marginalized voices and economic opportunities, it has also contributed to mental health issues among youth and facilitated the rapid spread of misinformation, prompting ongoing debates about regulation and the balance between benefits and harms.',
    },
    {
      title: 'Urban Heat Islands and City Planning',
      passage: `Urban heat islands are metropolitan areas that are significantly warmer than surrounding rural areas due to human activities. The primary causes include the replacement of natural land cover with buildings and pavements that absorb heat, waste heat from vehicles and air conditioning units, and reduced vegetation that would otherwise provide cooling through evapotranspiration. Average temperatures in urban areas can be 1 to 7 degrees Celsius higher than nearby rural regions. City planners are increasingly incorporating green infrastructure—such as rooftop gardens, urban forests, and permeable surfaces—to mitigate these effects. Research indicates that increasing urban green spaces by 10% could reduce surface temperatures by up to 3 degrees and significantly improve air quality and resident well-being.`,
      sampleAnswer: 'Urban heat islands, caused by the replacement of natural surfaces with heat-absorbing infrastructure and reduced vegetation, can raise city temperatures up to 7°C higher than rural areas, but city planners are addressing this through green infrastructure such as rooftop gardens and urban forests, which can reduce surface temperatures by up to 3°C.',
    },
    {
      title: 'The Future of Work',
      passage: `Automation and artificial intelligence are fundamentally reshaping the labour market. While previous technological revolutions eliminated certain jobs while creating new ones, the current wave of automation is notable for its speed and breadth. Routine cognitive tasks that once required human intelligence—such as data analysis, customer service, and even some aspects of medical diagnosis—can now be performed by algorithms. Economists disagree about the long-term net effect on employment. Optimists argue that new industries and job categories will emerge, as they have in past revolutions. Pessimists contend that the pace of change will outstrip workers' ability to adapt, leading to structural unemployment and growing inequality.`,
      sampleAnswer: 'Automation and artificial intelligence are transforming the labour market at unprecedented speed, with algorithms now capable of performing routine cognitive tasks such as data analysis and customer service, leading to disagreement among economists about whether new industries will emerge fast enough to offset job losses or whether structural unemployment and inequality will grow.',

Behavioural economics challenges this assumption by incorporating insights from psychology. Research by Kahneman and Tversky demonstrated that humans are subject to cognitive biases—systematic patterns of deviation from rationality. For example, loss aversion means people feel the pain of losses more strongly than equivalent gains. Anchoring bias causes us to rely too heavily on the first piece of information we encounter. These findings have profound implications for public policy, marketing, and financial decision-making.',

However, research over the past few decades has revealed that the brain retains remarkable plasticity throughout life. Neuroplasticity—the brain\'s ability to reorganise itself by forming new neural connections—plays a crucial role in learning, memory, and recovery from brain injuries. This discovery has led to new rehabilitation approaches for stroke patients and individuals with traumatic brain injuries.',
